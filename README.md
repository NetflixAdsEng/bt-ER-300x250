# ES6/Webpack Base

This is a Netflix Generic Source - Build Template.

It contains a starting point for standard/dynamic Monet banner executions. It is based on an open-source, ad-authoring platform called [FF0000 Ad Tech](https://github.com/ff0000-ad-tech)

## Usage

**You want to work off the files in `./dist/` folder.**

The top level of this project is for Container 2.0 scaffolding only, and it should not be utilized in your build.

### Starting a New Unit

For an overview of how to install & work with this template, please start with the [./dist/README.md].

You may also reach RED via Container 2.0 Slack channel, `c20support`, or `monet-developers` email aliases at `netflix.com`.

### Updating an Existing Unit

If you were linked here by an existing Container, and you need to make edits, you will need to use Creative Server. This will handle all of the compiling and packaging.

For more info, please go to [Creative Server - README](https://github.com/ff0000-ad-tech/wp-creative-server/blob/master/README.md) .
