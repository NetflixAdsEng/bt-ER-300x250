# ES6/Webpack Base

This is a starting point for standard Monet executions. It is based on an open-source, ad-authoring platform called [FF0000 Ad Tech](https://github.com/ff0000-ad-tech)

## Usage

### Starting a New Unit

For an overview of how to work with this template, please start with this [README](https://github.com/ff0000-ad-tech/tmpl-standard-base/blob/master/README.md).

You may also reach RED via `c20support` or `monet-developers` email aliases at `netflix.com`.

### Updating an Existing Unit

If you were linked here by an existing Container, and you need to make edits, you will need to use Creative Server. This will handle all of the compiling and packaging.

For more info, please go to [Creative Server - README](https://github.com/ff0000-ad-tech/wp-creative-server/blob/master/README.md) .
