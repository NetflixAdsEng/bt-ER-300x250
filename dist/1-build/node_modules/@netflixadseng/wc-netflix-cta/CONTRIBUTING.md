# Netflix Generic Source - WEB COMPONENT

## Overview

Generic Sources are the building blocks of Monet Containers. There are several types:

* **Build Templates**
* **Web Components**
* **Packages**

Web Components are a flexible, long-standing HTML/CSS/JS framework that is in a good position to become a browser standard. Netflix
uses the Web Components pattern for its ability to be implemented in a variety of ways: They are supported by Google Web Designer,
and, with polyfills and some tooling, they can be utilized in agency frameworks.

This scaffold provides tools that make it easier to author, test, maintain, share, and migrate Web Components.

## Installation

`npm install && npm run init`

* attaches the GS-tracker to GWD-manifest
* if there is a `./src/package.json`, then it will also be installed. This allows authors of this scaffold to bundle additional infrastructure, if needed.

Note that the `init` routine is seperate from the `postinstall` hook so that this project can be NPM-installed directly from GitHub, in which case, the 
"devDependencies" are not installed.

## Monet/C20 Compatibility

#### GENERIC SOURCE TRACKING

You will notice a file in your `./src` folder that looks like:

`c73f6129-5748-4609-ae15-a7b0ce6042af.js`

**Do not delete this file!** In fact, it should be distributed along with your published files.

This tracker file is used by Monet to identify this component. It is in the form of a JS file so that it can
be included in GWD manifest.json as a publishable dependency.

#### DEVELOPMENT vs. PUBLISHED

This switch is here: `package.json -> genericSource.state`. It's options are:

* `development`: Default state, the component will appear in Monet, but it will not be available for preview or download
* `published`: Production state, the component will appear in Monet with preview/download links to the `./dist/` folder
* `disabled`: Disabled state, the component will **not** appear in Monet

#### GWD Web Components

The GWD spec for authoring Web Components begins here [Using Custom Components](https://support.google.com/webdesigner/topic/6175722?hl=en&ref_topic=3181232).
The `manifest.json` is critical for our purposes.

The GWD `manifest.json` enables:

* the GWD application to surface the specified web-component UI to users
* this package's `./lib/api` to automatically build browser-ready versions of the web-component

## Development

### SRC

All of your dev should happen in `./src` folder. Please refer to the evolving standards surrounding Web Components.

The required file is `manifest.json` -- that describes the public features of your component. Detailed information
about the manifest format is here [Component JSON manifest](https://support.google.com/webdesigner/answer/6172389?hl=en).

Otherwise, you may own the `./src` folder. Add whatever scaffolding & build-dependencies you need to dev/build/maintain this component.

###### LOCALHOST

`npm run localhost`

* starts a python SimpleHTTPServer at http://0.0.0.0:8000/
* opens Chrome at that address

###### DOCUMENTATION

The `.src/` has it's own `README.md`. Please make use of it to communicate component functionality.

### BUILD

You must use `./src/manifest.json` to declare component dependencies. The format can be found here: [Component JSON manifest](https://support.google.com/webdesigner/answer/6172389?hl=en).

The component-API will use `./src/manifest.json` to automatically build a number of helper files (see below).

`npm run build`

* creates a Web Component "link file" (ex: `component_link.html`) from a GWD manifest.json
* creates a Web Component "preview file" (ex: `index.html`), which can run in a browser, load, and play the "link file"
* creates `./index.js` which enables this component to be added as an NPM-style dependency

### DIST

`npm run dist`

* copies `./src` to `./dist/src`
* creates a zip in `./dist/gwd` that can be imported as a Component in GWD
* marks the component as `published` in C20

### PUBLISHING

Install this global package https://github.com/sindresorhus/np

Then run `npm run pub`

## Note about this Scaffold

This repo was generated by Container 2.0 using [NetflixAdsEng/da-generic-source-scaffolding](https://github.com/NetflixAdsEng/da-generic-source-scaffolding).

To affect the initial state of these repos (for example, this README), please review that project and commit accordingly.

This project scaffolds a build process for src -> dist -> origin/master. Please go to the [./src folder README](./src) for more information about the distinct qualities of this component:

* its "context"
* base files / functionalities / interface / compatibilities
* authoring strategies
* etc.
